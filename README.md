Source code for the software contained on the two 3.5" diskettes included with
the text book "Introduction to Fourier Analysis", by Dr. Norman Morrison
(ISBN 978-0-471-01737-0).

Or as near as I could manage - the exact sources that produced the binaries on
the book's disks can't be found, but I've collected together the earliest DOS
and Mac sources I have, as well as the sources of my Win conversion.

The binaries built from the original sources can be found on the Internet
Archive, under [Introduction to Fourier Analysis - accompanying disk](https://archive.org/details/norms-fft-disk).
